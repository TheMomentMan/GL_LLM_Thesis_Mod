LLM_A,Novice,"Confirm that the current surface gas injection pressure and flow rate meet the original gas lift design. Compare live values to the minimum pressure required to open the deepest unloading valve. If pressure is marginal, the valve may not open consistently, leading to unstable injection depth",3,More details in the description of what needs to be done,Review annulus pressure behavior over 48 hours. The observed daytime pressure drop followed by nighttime recovery could indicate thermal effects or possible valve leak-through. Pressure falloff during high-rate periods might also reflect multipoint injection or shallow valve actuation,4,,"Use the acoustic gas lift tool to detect valve activity.
